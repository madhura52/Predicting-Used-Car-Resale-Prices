# Predicting Used Car Resale Prices 🚗📊

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on predicting the resale price of used cars by analyzing various features such as **year of manufacture, mileage, engine capacity, fuel type, brand, accident history**, and more.  
Through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, the project uncovers key insights that can help **buyers, sellers, and dealerships** make informed, data-driven pricing decisions.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform **data cleaning** and handle missing values & outliers.
- Explore **trends, distributions, and correlations** between features and car prices.
- Understand the impact of factors like **mileage, fuel type, engine capacity, and owner history**.
- Lay the groundwork for building a **machine learning model** for price prediction.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – Data visualization

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Mileage** has a slight positive correlation with resale price.
- **Electric cars** tend to have the highest resale value.
- **Engine capacity** positively impacts pricing.
- **Accident history** and higher **owner count** reduce resale value.
- **Red cars** with valid insurance often sell for higher prices.
